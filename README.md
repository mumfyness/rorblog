---------------------------------------------------------------
This is my first Ruby on Rails project:
I am learning Ruby on Rails in order 
to apply to a Full Stack Developer position in Seattle
https://pco.workable.com/jobs/779005
with Performance Center of Carlsbad, California.
I will work remotely from Seattle/Bellevue/Sammamish washington.
But as my kids are going to school and living in La Mirada, California
I would be happy to come down to Carlsbad occassionally.

As I am developing Ruby on Rails skills, 
I am finding Ruby and Rails very intriguing.
I continue to learn more every day.

As I developed this project (still working on it), 
I realized I want to rename a few things, but for the sake of brevity
and learning I will note that and continue:
I have been working on a Webservice for Wedding photographers originally Spring Boot based.
I decided to try it out here in Ruby on Rails.
This project is in progress.
